<p id="intro">
In 2008, something remarkable happened.
<br><br>

Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin: a system where strangers could exchange value<br>
without trusting a bank, government, or any central authority.<br>
For over a decade, Bitcoin has worked. Not because everyone is honest,<br>
but because the system is <i>designed</i> to work even when people try to cheat.
<br><br>

But here's the puzzle: <b>How does trust emerge without a trusted authority?</b><br>
Why don't miners attack the network? Why do nodes validate transactions<br>
they don't have to? What incentives keep Bitcoin decentralized and secure?
<br><br>

I think <b>game theory</b> can explain Bitcoin's security model –<br>
and how decentralization beats centralization. So, to understand it...
</p>
<p id="intro_button">
...let's play a game about Bitcoin. &rarr;

<b>A SINGLE TRANSACTION</b>
<br>
Imagine you want to send bitcoin to someone.
If you broadcast an honest transaction (COOPERATE), the network validates it – everyone benefits.
You could also broadcast a conflicting transaction (ATTACK/CHEAT) trying to double-spend the same coins.
Each participant can either COOPERATE (validate honestly) or CHEAT (ignore invalid transactions for profit).
</p>

<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
<b>Let's say the other participant cheats, ignoring consensus rules and accepting your fake transaction.</b><br>
What should you do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
Right! Don't let them double-spend you while you play by the rules.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Too idealistic – they just robbed you while you played fair!
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
If you cooperate (follow rules) &amp; they cheat (accept invalid tx), you lose security while they gain unfair advantage. (score: -1 vs +3)
However, if you both cheat, neither of you can trust the network anymore. (score: 0 vs 0)
<b>Therefore: you should also CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
<b>But let's say the other participant cooperates, validating transactions honestly.</b><br>
What should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
Harsh... but yes, if you can get away with breaking the rules, you might gain short-term advantage.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Noble! Sure, seems right... <b>OR IS IT??</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
Because if you both cooperate, the network works perfectly &amp; you both benefit from valid transactions. (score: +2 vs +2)
But if you cheat &amp; they follow rules, you might succeed in a double-spend they won't catch. (score: +3 vs -1)
<b>Therefore: you "should" still CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
And <i>that's</i> Bitcoin's core challenge.
Individual participants have incentive to attack the network, even if it destroys value for everyone.
Sometimes, breaking the rules <i>seems</i> rational in isolation!
But what happens if we play this game...

<p id="iterated_intro_top">
<b>The Blockchain: A Repeated Game</b>
Now, Bitcoin isn't a single transaction – it's an <i>ongoing sequence</i> of rounds.
You'll face the same network participants again and again, round after round.
With each round, you'll see 3 to 7 consecutive blocks.
The question: will others trust you? And more importantly: can you afford to break their trust?
</p>

<p id="iterated_intro_btm">
Make your first <i>real</i> move. <b>Choose wisely.</b>
</p>

<p id="iterated_score_start">
And your total reward is...
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_1">

</p>
<p id="iterated_score_2">
which could have been much better – the network didn't trust you.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_3">
which is respectable! You earned decent rewards.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_4">
which is solid! The network rewarded your honesty.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_5">
which is <i>optimal!</i> You maximized your gains through consistent cooperation.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_x">
...i have no idea how you hacked this.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_end">
(the lowest &amp; highest possible scores are 7 and 49, respectively)
</p>

<p id="reputation_earned">
Your reputation score has been calculated based on your cooperation and defection moves.
</p>

<p id="reputation_offer">
Would you like to record your game to Bitcoin? Your reputation score would be anchored on-chain, giving you voting power in community governance decisions.
</p>

<p id="who_were">
So who were these different network participants you interacted with?
</p>

<p id="character_tft">
<b>HONEST NODE:</b>
Hello! I validate correctly in block 1, then I copy whatever you did in the last block.
If you cheated, I remember and respond. Fair is fair.
</p>

<p id="character_all_d">
<b>51% ATTACKER:</b>
<i>might makes right – I mine my own rules</i>
</p>

<p id="character_all_c">
<b>FULL NODE:</b>
I always follow consensus rules, no matter what. The network is stronger when everyone validates honestly.
</p>

<p id="character_grudge">
<b>CHAIN VALIDATOR:</b>
Listen here. I'll validate everything correctly &amp; enforce consensus,
but if you ever break the rules &amp; double-spend, I will REJECT EVERY TRANSACTION FROM YOU 'TIL THE END.
</p>

<p id="character_prober">
<b>ADAPTIVE NODE:</b>
First: I test you. I try: validate honestly, attempt a double-spend, validate, validate again.
If you reject my double-spend, I'll validate honestly like the Honest Node.
If you accept it, I'll attack you relentlessly like the 51% Attacker.
</p>

<p id="characters_teaser">
Now, what if these network participants were to interact...
</p>
<p id="characters_button">
...in a full tournament? &rarr;
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - TOURNAMENT! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="place_your_bets">
It's network tournament time!
Each node type will now interact with every other node type:
that's 10 paired interactions, and 10 rounds per interaction.
<br><br>
Which node type do you think will accumulate the highest total score?
<b>Think carefully... and then PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="tournament_intro">
Alright, you predicted [CHAR] would win!
Let's go through the interactions one by one, and see who dominates the network...
</p>

<p id="first_match">
first interaction &rarr;
</p>

<p id="next_match">
next interaction &rarr;
</p>

<p id="match_header_1">
<b>Interaction #[N]:</b> [A] vs [B]
</p>
<p id="match_header_2">
<b>Rounds:</b>
</p>
<p id="match_header_3">
<b>Total Scores:</b> [A] vs [B]
</p>

<p id="tournament_1">
But wait, consider this historical context:
</p>
<p id="tournament_2">
Bitcoin has survived 15+ years without a centralized authority.
Thousands of independent nodes validate transactions daily.
But why? Individual miners could cheat. Any node could compromise.
</p>
<p id="tournament_3">
The answer isn't <i>universal honesty</i> – it's better than that.
Bitcoin's security comes from <i>repeated interactions</i>.
</p>
<p id="tournament_4">
Every node interacts with the same network participants over and over.
Every miner faces the same consensus rules repeatedly.
Attack once, and your reputation is destroyed. Honest behavior is rewarded continuously.
</p>
<p id="tournament_5">
Even before Bitcoin's formal design, communities using sound money
independently discovered similar principles: 
repeated interaction builds trust.
</p>
<p id="tournament_6">
They called it: <b>the credibility &amp; reputation system</b>.
You don't attack your peers when you know you'll face them tomorrow.
And this works remarkably well!
</p>
<p id="tournament_7">
But you might still be skeptical. Miners have different incentives.
What makes Bitcoin's repeated-game structure so powerful?
</p>
<p id="tournament_8">
Well, here's what's unique about Bitcoin:
Unlike centralized systems where authority can change rules,
nodes face the <i>exact same consensus rules</i> every block, forever.
</p>
<p id="tournament_9">
<b>It's an infinitely repeated game.</b> And that changes everything.
</p>
<p id="tournament_10">
And the dominant strategy is...
</p>

<p id="the_winner_is">
(drumroll please...) &rarr;
</p>

<p id="tournament_winner_1">
<b class="tft">HONEST NODE!</b>
</p>
<p id="tournament_winner_2_yay">
Congrats, your prediction was correct.
</p>
<p id="tournament_winner_2_nay">
(Sorry about your prediction: [CHAR].)
</p>
<p id="tournament_winner_3">
The Honest Node goes by many names.
Tit-for-tat, reciprocal validation, proof-of-work fairness, or... <b>honest consensus.</b>
That's why Bitcoin works despite missing a central authority:
when you're forced to play the same cryptographic game with the same rules forever –
the Honest Node doesn't just win a single block, it wins across all blocks.
<br><br>
But if cooperation wins in repeated games, why is the world full of attacks & forks?
What if we simulate multiple generations of nodes evolving?
</p>
<p id="tournament_teaser">
Let's watch evolution in action. &rarr;
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - EVOLUTION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="evolution_intro">
Now, let's imagine Bitcoin's node population <i>evolving over time</i>. The process is simple:
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_1">
<b>1. RUN A FULL TOURNAMENT</b><br>
All node types validate &amp; interact; tally their rewards.
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_2">
<b>2. RETIRE WORST NODES</b><br>
Remove the 5 lowest-scoring node types. (ties broken randomly)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_3">
<b>3. ADD COPIES OF BEST NODES</b><br>
Clone the 5 highest-scoring node types. (ties broken randomly)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_footer">
...and REPEAT. Think of this as natural selection:
bad strategies are replaced, good strategies spread.
All that's needed is that unsuccessful behaviors (low scores) go away,
and successful behaviors (high scores) are imitated by new nodes.
So now...
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_button">
...let's watch this unfold. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_1">
Say Bitcoin's network starts with:
<span class="all_c">15 Full Nodes</span> (always validate honestly),
<span class="all_d">5 51% Attackers</span> (always attack), and
<span class="tft">5 Honest Nodes</span> (validate fairly, respond to attacks).
(We'll ignore <span class="grudge">Chain Validator</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Adaptive Node</span> for now)
<br><br>
We're going to simulate the tournament-retire-clone cycle a dozen times.
Let's make another bet! Who do you think wins the <i>first</i> tournament?
<b>PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="evo_2_all_c">
Makes sense, Full Nodes outnumber everyone – honesty should dominate right now...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_all_d">
Makes sense, 51% Attackers can exploit the trusting Full Nodes...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_tft">
Makes sense, Honest Nodes won the tournament already, why not again?...
</p>
<p id="evo_2">
Let's see if you're right:
</p>

<p id="label_play_tournament">
1) run tournament
</p>
<p id="label_eliminate_bottom_5">
2) retire bottom 5
</p>
<p id="label_reproduce_top_5">
3) replicate top 5
</p>

<p id="evo_3_all_c">
Sadly, <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> got exploited by
<span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span>, whose population increased.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_all_d">
You're right! <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> won this round,
exploiting the naive <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_tft">
Sadly, <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> didn't win – but they survived better than <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>,
who got exploited by <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span>.
</p>
<p id="evo_3">
Let's see what happens over several more rounds...
</p>

<p id="evo_4">
<span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> are still growing,
while <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> keep shrinking...
</p>

<p id="evo_5">
And now, all the <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> are gone.
But wait...
</p>

<p id="evo_6">
Exactly! <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> destroyed themselves!
They exploited the naive <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>,
but once they eliminated them, they had to face the <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span>:
who follow rules, but aren't gullible.
</p>

<p id="evo_7">
By validating fairly &amp; responding proportionally to attacks,
<span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> thrive together,
while <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> destroy each other!
Not only that – <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> punish attackers
by refusing to accept their blocks.
</p>

<p id="evo_8">
And so, inevitably...
</p>

<p id="evo_9">
...<span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> inherit the network.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_c">
So, although your prediction was off – the naive <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>
were doomed from the start – ultimately, smart honesty won,
and the <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> failed.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_d">
Right for the short term – <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> won early –
but in the long run, their strategy collapsed.
You can't sustain attacks when other nodes reject your blocks.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_tft">
Yes! <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> dominated in the long run.
<span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> may have won early,
but their exploitative strategy was ultimately self-defeating.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_end">
This reminds me of Bitcoin's first decade:
attacks were tried, but the network's honest majority 
rejected them &amp; moved forward. Security emerged from consensus,
not from central authority.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_btn">
(oh, and by the way...)
</p>

<p id="evo_10">
(...results are similar even if we include
<span class="grudge">Chain Validators</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Adaptive Nodes</span>:)
</p>

<p id="evo_autoplay">
start the evolution process!
</p>
<p id="evo_autoplay_stop">
stop the evolution process
</p>

<p id="evo_10_followup">
(Note: occasionally, <span class="grudge">Chain Validators</span> persist
alongside <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span>, because they score equally well.)
<br><br>
Game theory suggests something profound:
the honesty enforced by Bitcoin's consensus rules isn't just good policy – 
it's mathematically optimal. <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> win because
they cooperate when others cooperate, &amp; punish defectors immediately.
However...
</p>
<p id="evo_10_btn">
...there's still a problem: &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_11">
Look at the real world. Miners still attack. Consensus rules get forked.
<br><br>
If honesty &amp; fair validation are so mathematically superior –
if 15 years of Bitcoin evolution has shown <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> dominate –
why do attacks happen? Why do chains fragment? What causes network distrust?
<br><br>
The answer is in the question itself: we're talking about <i>game structure.</i>
What happens when the game <i>itself</i> changes?
What could cause <i>strategic dishonesty</i> to emerge?
<br><br>
What could lead to...
</p>
<p id="evo_11_btn">
...the evolution of <i>distrust?</i>
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - DISTRUST - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="distrust_1">
Before everything breaks down, let's start with a healthy network!
Here's a majority of <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> validating honestly,
plus one <span class="all_d">51% Attacker</span> and one <span class="tft">Honest Node</span>.
<br><br>
Use the buttons to step through the evolution round-by-round,
or let it play out automatically. Watch what happens to trust. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_2">
As you know, <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> dominate under normal circumstances!
<br><br>
But that's under <i>current</i> rules. What if we change the game
by introducing <i>network delay</i> – blocks take time to propagate?
</p>

<p id="distrust_3">
Now, what if block propagation isn't instant?
</p>

<p id="distrust_3_small">
(what does latency mean for the game? let's see...)
</p>

<p id="distrust_4_top">
When block propagation is delayed, nodes don't all see the same chain at the same time.
This creates an opportunity:
</p>

<p id="distrust_4a">
<b>The race attack:</b> You mine a block secretly. While others validate it, 
you start mining the next block yourself.
When your block propagates, you might have a 2-block lead!
This hidden mining (selfish mining) can be profitable if you have enough hash power.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_a">
If a node knows others will see its blocks with delay,
it can <i>exploit</i> that delay by mining in secret.
Suddenly, <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> becomes profitable even against <span class="tft">Copycat</span>!
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_b">
This is called: <b>selfish mining</b>.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_c">
If people can't see what you're doing, game theory shifts.
Honest behavior is rewarded less. Selfish behavior is rewarded more.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4_btm">
Now the whole network spirals into distrust:
</p>

<p id="distrust_5">
Because some miners can profit from selfish mining when latency is high,
their share of the network grows.
As dishonest miners become common, even honest miners feel pressured to attack
to stay competitive.
</p>

<p id="distrust_6">
And once everyone is attacking each other?
Nobody can trust anybody.
The network fractures.
Different mining pools create different fork chains.
Security degrades.
</p>

<p id="distrust_7">
So our epidemic of distrust comes from <b>changing the game structure.</b>
When participants can't observe each other's actions clearly,
when delays create information asymmetry,
when incentives reward hidden behavior...
trust collapses, <i>even among rational actors.</i>
</p>

<p id="distrust_8">
This is Bitcoin's core challenge:
<b>How do we design the game so that honesty remains profitable
even when observation is imperfect?</b>
</p>

<p id="distrust_8_btm">
Solutions include:
</p>

<p id="distrust_8a">
<b>Faster blocks:</b> Reduce latency so selfish mining is harder.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8b">
<b>Stronger consensus rules:</b> Make attacks visible &amp; punishable.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8c">
<b>Decentralized validation:</b> More independent nodes catch attacks faster.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8d">
<b>Better incentives:</b> Reward behavior that strengthens the network,
not just individual profit.
</p>

<p id="distrust_9_top">
But these solutions create a tension:
stronger consensus rules can be fragile.
</p>

<p id="distrust_9">
Interestingly, Bitcoin's solution wasn't to centralize authority
(which would solve the game but destroy decentralization).
Instead, Bitcoin:
</p>

<p id="distrust_10a">
<b>Made the rules transparent:</b> Everyone agrees on the same consensus rules,
globally, forever.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10b">
<b>Made attacks visible:</b> Any deviation from consensus is immediately detectable
by anyone running a node.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10c">
<b>Made punishment automatic:</b> Invalid blocks are rejected. Cheaters gain nothing.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10d">
<b>Made the game infinite:</b> Miners face the same rules forever,
so short-term attack gains don't justify long-term reputation loss.
</p>

<p id="distrust_11_top">
By changing the game structure itself,
Bitcoin made honesty the dominant strategy.
Not because everyone is good,
but because the rules make cheating unprofitable.
</p>

<p id="distrust_11_end">
So now, the question becomes:
How do we further strengthen these rules?
How do we make attacks even more costly?
How do we scale decentralization while maintaining game-theoretic security?
</p>

<p id="distrust_btn">
And how do we use cryptographic proofs to verify this? &rarr;
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - NOISE! - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="noise_intro">
<b>But there's another challenge:</b>
What if nodes make <i>honest mistakes</i>?
</p>

<p id="noise_intro_small">
(what does noise (mistakes) do to the game?)
</p>

<p id="noise_1">
Here's the same network, but now there's a 1% chance each block is validated incorrectly
(due to software bugs, hardware faults, network glitches, etc).
</p>

<p id="noise_2_top">
Oh no!
</p>

<p id="noise_2">
<span class="all_c">Naive Full Nodes</span>, who always trust others' blocks,
get tricked by mistakes into accepting invalid data.
Their trust is punished by the network rejecting their chains.
</p>

<p id="noise_3">
But notice: <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> still survive!
</p>

<p id="noise_4">
Why? Because they don't just validate once – they maintain state.
They catch mistakes when they see conflicting data,
and they respond by being more defensive next time.
</p>

<p id="noise_5">
This is why Bitcoin has:
</p>

<p id="noise_5a">
<b>Full nodes running the full validation:</b>
Don't trust, verify. Every rule, every time.
</p>

<p id="noise_5b">
<b>Peer review of code changes:</b>
Network upgrades require consensus of honest nodes.
</p>

<p id="noise_5c">
<b>Checkpoints &amp; consensus rules:</b>
If a majority of nodes see conflicting data, the chain reorg.
</p>

<p id="noise_6_top">
The lesson: <b>Even with noise, the game works.</b>
</p>

<p id="noise_6">
But only if:
1. Nodes validate independently
2. They respond to errors (don't just trust)
3. They maintain a shared record (consensus)
</p>

<p id="noise_6_end">
Robust systems aren't built on perfect actors.
They're built on game theory that survives imperfect information.

<span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> win when:
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_1">
...the reward for mutual honesty (R) is high enough
compared to temptation (T).
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_2">
...the network can punish cheaters fast enough
that they don't accumulate wealth.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_3">
...honest nodes outnumber dishonest ones initially,
OR the rules make dishonesty unprofitable from the start.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_4">
...the game is repeated infinitely,
so short-term gains don't outweigh long-term losses.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_5">
Think of the implications:
Bitcoin's rules (block rewards, mining difficulty, consensus)
are designed to make honesty the dominant strategy.
Not through central authority enforcing rules,
but through game-theoretic incentives that work even among strangers.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_conclusion">
So remember: <b>Trust isn't binary.</b>
You don't need to trust people – you need to design games where honesty is the <i>only</i> profitable strategy.
And that's what decentralization achieves.

<p id="conclusion_top">
<b>So here's what we learned:</b>
</p>

<p id="conclusion_1">
Single transactions create a prisoner's dilemma: rational actors cheat.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_2">
Repeated games change everything: honest strategies win because players face each other forever.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_3">
Tournament evolution shows: even when cheaters start strong, honesty dominates long-term.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_4">
Changing the game (adding delays, noise, attacks) can make trust collapse...
</p>

<p id="conclusion_5">
...but stronger consensus rules, transparency, &amp; verification can restore it.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_6">
Bitcoin applies these principles:
Global consensus rules. Transparent validation. Punishing cheaters automatically.
Infinite repetition. Decentralized participation.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_7">
The result: a system where millions of strangers maintain a shared ledger
<i>without trusting a central authority.</i>
Not because everyone is honest – but because honesty is the only profitable strategy.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_end">
That's the evolution of trust.
And now, using Charms protocol, we can make these game moves verifiable on-chain.

Now comes the powerful part: your game history proves your trustworthiness.
</p>

<p id="governance_intro_text">
Your moves have built a reputation.<br><br>

In Bitcoin, reputation determines influence. Nodes that validate honestly earn the right to shape network rules.<br><br>

<b>Now YOU get to vote.</b> Using your reputation score, you can propose and vote on changes to how the game works.<br><br>

Your votes will be recorded on-chain as a permanent part of Bitcoin's history.

<p id="governance_explain">
If you recorded your game to Bitcoin, your reputation is anchored on-chain.
This reputation isn't just a score—it's voting power in community governance.
</p>

<p id="governance_example">
For example: The community might propose "Change the reward for mutual cooperation from 2 to 3 coins."
Your voting weight would be proportional to your reputation score.
If the proposal passes, the next generation of games uses the new rules—decided by the community, executed on Bitcoin.
</p>

<p id="governance_vision">
This is programmable Bitcoin: game theory, reputation systems, and governance all working together.
No central authority. No oracle. Just math, incentives, and decentralized consensus.
