<p id="intro">
In 2008, something remarkable happened.
<br><br>

Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin: a system where strangers could exchange value<br>
without trusting a bank, government, or any central authority.<br>
For over a decade, Bitcoin has worked. Not because everyone is honest,<br>
but because the system is <i>designed</i> to work even when people try to cheat.
<br><br>

<b>But here's the problem Bitcoin solved:</b><br>
How do you prevent double-spending without a central ledger-keeper?<br>
If Alice and Bob both claim ownership of the same coin, who decides who's right?<br>
Normally, you need a bank. But Bitcoin has no bank. So how does it work?
<br><br>

This is called <b>the Byzantine Generals Problem.</b> Imagine an army with generals<br>
scattered across a battlefield. They need to coordinate an attack, but some generals<br>
might be traitors. How do they reach consensus when they can't trust each other?<br>
For decades, computer scientists thought this was impossible without a trusted authority.
<br><br>

But here's the genius insight: <b>Game theory solves it.</b><br>
Bitcoin doesn't require trust. It requires <i>incentives</i> that make honesty profitable<br>
and dishonesty unprofitable. Why don't miners attack the network?<br>
Why do nodes validate transactions they don't have to?<br>
Because the rules reward cooperation and punish attacks.
<br><br>

Let's see how this works...
</p>
<p id="intro_button">
...let's play a game about Bitcoin. &rarr;
</p>

<!-- - - - - WHY THIS WORKS - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="why_this_works_top">
<b>Why Bitcoin's approach worked when others failed</b>
</p>

<p id="why_this_works_1">
Governments and banks solved double-spending with <i>a ledger-keeper:</i> a central authority<br>
who decides which transactions are valid. Trust the bank, you trust the system.
<br><br>
But cryptographers wanted to do it without a central authority. They tried signatures, hashing, encryption.<br>
None of it worked. Without a central timestamp, you can't prove which coin was spent first.
</p>

<p id="why_this_works_2">
Bitcoin's breakthrough: <b>A distributed ledger + game theory.</b>
<br><br>
Instead of one ledger-keeper, there are thousands of nodes.
Instead of requiring trust, Bitcoin requires <i>proof-of-work</i> + <i>incentives.</i>
<br><br>
• You can't rewrite the past (proof-of-work makes attacks expensive)<br>
• You can't fake the majority (you need 51% hash power)<br>
• You aren't incentivized to attack (honest mining is more profitable)<br>
• The game is eternal (today's attack destroys tomorrow's rewards)
</p>

<p id="why_this_works_btn">
So let's play the game Bitcoin nodes play every day. &rarr;

<b>A SINGLE TRANSACTION</b>
<br>
Imagine you're a miner wanting to send bitcoin. Two paths:
<br><br>
<b>COOPERATE:</b> You follow Bitcoin's consensus rules. You validate transactions honestly, include them in your block. 
The network accepts your block, you earn a reward. Everyone's transactions work. Network stays secure.
<br><br>
<b>CHEAT:</b> You ignore consensus rules. You accept invalid transactions or double-spend coins.
You earn short-term profit, but other nodes reject your block. Your coins get orphaned.
<br><br>
Each participant faces the same choice. What should <b>you</b> do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
<b>Let's say the other miner cheats: they broadcast an invalid block trying to double-spend.</b><br>
Should you cooperate or also cheat?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
Right! Don't let them double-spend you while you play by the rules.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Too idealistic – they just robbed you while you played fair!
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
If you cooperate &amp; they cheat, you lose: they accept invalid transactions and benefit unfairly (+3) while your honest block gets rejected (-1).
However, if you both cheat, the network breaks. Neither of you can trust it anymore. (both 0)
<b>Therefore: it seems logical to CHEAT.</b>
<br><br>
But this is a single transaction. Bitcoin isn't a single transaction. It's eternal repetition.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
<b>But let's say the other participant cooperates, validating transactions honestly.</b><br>
What should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
Harsh... but yes, if you can get away with breaking the rules, you might gain short-term advantage.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Noble! Sure, seems right... <b>OR IS IT??</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
Because if you both cooperate, the network works perfectly &amp; you both benefit from valid transactions. (score: +2 vs +2)
But if you cheat &amp; they follow rules, you might succeed in a double-spend they won't catch. (score: +3 vs -1)
<b>Therefore: you "should" still CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
And <i>that's</i> Bitcoin's core challenge.
Individual participants have incentive to attack the network, even if it destroys value for everyone.
Sometimes, breaking the rules <i>seems</i> rational in isolation!
But what happens if we play this game...
</p>

<p id="iterated_intro_top">
<b>The Blockchain: A Repeated Game (This is why Bitcoin works)</b>
<br><br>
Bitcoin isn't a single transaction – it's an <i>infinite sequence</i> of blocks, forever.
You'll validate transactions against the same network participants, round after round, every 10 minutes, for all eternity.
<br><br>
In a single game, cheating seems rational. In a repeated game? Everything changes.
Attack once, and every other node blacklists you. Defend your reputation, and you earn rewards forever.
<br><br>
The question: will others trust you? And critically: <b>can you afford to break their trust?</b>
</p>

<p id="iterated_intro_btm">
This is your actual choice, played out over blocks. <b>Choose wisely.</b>
</p>

</p>
</p>
<p id="iterated_info_2">

</p>
<p id="iterated_score_1">
which is, wow, <i>embarrassingly</i> low. You got attacked constantly.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_2">
which could have been much better – the network didn't trust you.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_3">
which is respectable! You earned decent rewards.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_4">

</p>
<p id="iterated_score_5">
which is <i>optimal!</i> You maximized your gains through consistent cooperation.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_x">
...i have no idea how you hacked this.
</p>
<p id="iterated_score_end">
(the lowest &amp; highest possible scores are 7 and 49, respectively)
</p>

<p id="reputation_earned">
Your game is complete. Let's calculate your reputation.
</p>

<p id="reputation_reveal">
You cooperated [COOPERATION_COUNT] times. You defected [DEFECTION_COUNT] times.
That's a [COOPERATION_RATE]% cooperation rate, earning you <span class="[TIER_CLASS]">[TIER_LABEL]</span> status.
<br><br>
In Bitcoin, this score means something tangible:
<br>
If you were a node validating transactions, [TIER_LABEL] nodes are [TIER_DESCRIPTION].
Your voting power on protocol changes would be [VOTING_POWER] votes.
</p>

<p id="reputation_what_it_means">
<b>What does [TIER_LABEL] mean in Bitcoin?</b>
<br><br>
<b>Trusted nodes (75%+):</b> These are the miners and validators the community trusts with network upgrades. Their proposals get heard. Their votes carry weight. When they propose rule changes, other nodes listen.
<br><br>
<b>Neutral nodes (50-74%):</b> These are solid, mostly-honest participants. They contribute to consensus but haven't proven exceptional reliability. Their votes count, but they don't have outsized influence.
<br><br>
<b>Learning nodes (0-49%):</b> These participants defected frequently. Bitcoin's design punishes this—attackers face network rejection. Your participation helps, but you haven't yet proven you're trustworthy with governance power.
</p>

<p id="reputation_reveal_btn">
See what this means →
</p>

<p id="reputation_offer">
Your reputation proves your trustworthiness. Would you like to record it to Bitcoin? 
This anchors your reputation on-chain permanently, giving you voting power on community proposals that shape Bitcoin's future.
</p>

<p id="who_were">
So who were these different network participants you interacted with?
</p>

<p id="character_tft">
<b>HONEST NODE (Tit-for-Tat):</b>
I validate your transactions fairly. In the next block, I mirror what you did: if you cooperated, I cooperate. If you cheated, I respond proportionally.
This is Bitcoin's backbone. I maintain reputation—don't damage it.
</p>

<p id="character_all_d">
<b>51% ATTACKER:</b>
I have enough hash power to ignore Bitcoin's consensus rules. I mine invalid blocks. I double-spend. I ignore what anyone else does.
Short-term profit. Long-term: the rest of the network simply rejects me.
</p>

<p id="character_all_c">
<b>FULL NODE (Always-Cooperate):</b>
I validate everything according to Bitcoin's rules, period. No matter what you do. No matter the incentives.
Pure consensus enforcement. But this naivety? It gets exploited by attackers.
</p>

<p id="character_grudge">
<b>CHAIN VALIDATOR (Punisher):</b>
I validate fairly, but I keep a permanent blacklist. Double-spend once? I reject every block from you forever.
This is Bitcoin's immune system: nodes that remember attackers and permanently exile them.
</p>

<p id="character_prober">
<b>ADAPTIVE NODE (Tester):</b>
First block: I validate honestly to test your response. Second block: I attempt a double-spend.
If you reject it, I know you're serious about consensus—I cooperate forever.
If you accept it, I know you're exploitable—I attack relentlessly.
</p>

<p id="characters_teaser">
Now, what if these network participants were to interact...
</p>
<p id="characters_button">
...in a full tournament? &rarr;

<!-- - - - - TOURNAMENT! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="place_your_bets">
It's network tournament time!
Each node type will now interact with every other node type:
that's 10 paired interactions, and 10 rounds per interaction.
<br><br>
Which node type do you think will accumulate the highest total score?
<b>Think carefully... and then PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="tournament_intro">
Alright, you predicted [CHAR] would win!
Let's go through the interactions one by one, and see who dominates the network...

</p>

<p id="tournament_1">
But wait, consider this historical context:
</p>
<p id="tournament_2">
Bitcoin has survived 15+ years without a centralized authority.
Thousands of independent nodes validate transactions daily.
But why? Individual miners could cheat. Any node could compromise.
</p>
<p id="tournament_3">
The answer isn't <i>universal honesty</i> – it's better than that.
Bitcoin's security comes from <i>repeated interactions</i>.
</p>
<p id="tournament_4">
Every node interacts with the same network participants over and over.
Every miner faces the same consensus rules repeatedly.
Attack once, and your reputation is destroyed. Honest behavior is rewarded continuously.
</p>
<p id="tournament_5">
Even before Bitcoin's formal design, communities using sound money
independently discovered similar principles: 
repeated interaction builds trust.
</p>
<p id="tournament_6">
They called it: <b>the credibility &amp; reputation system</b>.
You don't attack your peers when you know you'll face them tomorrow.
And this works remarkably well!
</p>
<p id="tournament_7">
But you might still be skeptical. Miners have different incentives.
What makes Bitcoin's repeated-game structure so powerful?
</p>
<p id="tournament_8">
Well, here's what's unique about Bitcoin:
Unlike centralized systems where authority can change rules,
nodes face the <i>exact same consensus rules</i> every block, forever.
</p>
<p id="tournament_9">
<b>It's an infinitely repeated game.</b> And that changes everything.
</p>
<p id="tournament_10">
And the dominant strategy is...
</p>

<p id="the_winner_is">
(drumroll please...) &rarr;
</p>

<p id="tournament_winner_1">
<b class="tft">HONEST NODE!</b>
</p>
<p id="tournament_winner_2_yay">
Congrats, your prediction was correct.
</p>
<p id="tournament_winner_2_nay">
(Sorry about your prediction: [CHAR].)
</p>
<p id="tournament_winner_3">
The Honest Node goes by many names in Bitcoin: Tit-for-Tat, reciprocal validation, responsive consensus, or just... <b>the majority of nodes that keep Bitcoin alive.</b>
<br><br>
That's why Bitcoin works despite having no central authority:
Every node follows the same cryptographic rules. Every node responds to violations.
When someone attacks the network, honest nodes reject the attack. When someone cooperates, they're rewarded.
<br><br>
This isn't accidental. Bitcoin's design forces the honest node strategy to dominate.
Miners who validate fairly earn block rewards <i>forever</i>. Attackers earn short-term profit, then face eternal rejection.
<br><br>
But if cooperation wins in repeated games, why have there been attacks & hard forks throughout Bitcoin's history?
What if we simulate how node populations actually evolve over time?
</p>
<p id="tournament_teaser">
Let's watch evolution in action. &rarr;
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - EVOLUTION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="evolution_intro">
Now, let's imagine Bitcoin's node population <i>evolving over time</i>. The process is simple:
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_1">
<b>1. RUN A FULL TOURNAMENT</b><br>
All node types validate &amp; interact; tally their rewards.
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_2">
<b>2. RETIRE WORST NODES</b><br>
Remove the 5 lowest-scoring node types. (ties broken randomly)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_3">
<b>3. ADD COPIES OF BEST NODES</b><br>
Clone the 5 highest-scoring node types. (ties broken randomly)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_footer">
...and REPEAT. Think of this as natural selection:
bad strategies are replaced, good strategies spread.
All that's needed is that unsuccessful behaviors (low scores) go away,
and successful behaviors (high scores) are imitated by new nodes.
So now...
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_button">
...let's watch this unfold. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_1">
Say Bitcoin's network starts with:
<span class="all_c">15 Full Nodes</span> (always validate honestly),
<span class="all_d">5 51% Attackers</span> (always attack), and
<span class="tft">5 Honest Nodes</span> (validate fairly, respond to attacks).
(We'll ignore <span class="grudge">Chain Validator</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Adaptive Node</span> for now)
<br><br>
We're going to simulate the tournament-retire-clone cycle a dozen times.
Let's make another bet! Who do you think wins the <i>first</i> tournament?
<b>PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="evo_2_all_c">
Makes sense, Full Nodes outnumber everyone – honesty should dominate right now...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_all_d">
Makes sense, 51% Attackers can exploit the trusting Full Nodes...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_tft">
Makes sense, Honest Nodes won the tournament already, why not again?...
</p>
<p id="evo_2">
Let's see if you're right:
</p>

<p id="label_play_tournament">
1) run tournament
</p>
<p id="label_eliminate_bottom_5">
2) retire bottom 5
</p>
<p id="label_reproduce_top_5">
3) replicate top 5
</p>

<p id="evo_3_all_c">
Sadly, <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> got exploited by
<span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span>, whose population increased.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_all_d">
You're right! <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> won this round,
exploiting the naive <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_tft">
Sadly, <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> didn't win – but they survived better than <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>,
who got exploited by <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span>.
</p>
<p id="evo_3">
Let's see what happens over several more rounds...
</p>

<p id="evo_4">
<span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> are still growing,
while <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> keep shrinking...
</p>

<p id="evo_5">
And now, all the <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> are gone.
But wait...
</p>

<p id="evo_6">
Exactly! <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> destroyed themselves!
They exploited the naive <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>,
but once they eliminated them, they had to face the <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span>:
who follow rules, but aren't gullible.
</p>

<p id="evo_7">
By validating fairly &amp; responding proportionally to attacks,
<span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> thrive together,
while <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> destroy each other!
Not only that – <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> punish attackers
by refusing to accept their blocks.
</p>

<p id="evo_8">
And so, inevitably...
</p>

<p id="evo_9">
...<span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> inherit the network.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_c">
So, although your prediction was off – the naive <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span>
were doomed from the start – ultimately, smart honesty won,
and the <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> failed.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_d">
Right for the short term – <span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> won early –
but in the long run, their strategy collapsed.
You can't sustain attacks when other nodes reject your blocks.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_tft">
Yes! <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> dominated in the long run.
<span class="all_d">51% Attackers</span> may have won early,
but their exploitative strategy was ultimately self-defeating.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_end">
This is Bitcoin's actual history:
<br><br>
In 2010, someone attempted to exploit the system (the Bitcoin overflow exploit). The honest majority caught it &amp; rejected it.
In 2013-2015, various pools tried 51% attacks or double-spending. Honest nodes blacklisted them.
In 2017, the "Bitcoin Cash" fork attempt divided the community—but the larger honest majority won, maintaining the original Bitcoin.
<br><br>
Every time, security emerged from consensus, not from central authority. The honest node strategy dominated because it had to.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_btn">
(oh, and by the way...)
</p>

<p id="evo_10">
(...results are similar even if we include
<span class="grudge">Chain Validators</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Adaptive Nodes</span>:)
</p>

<p id="evo_autoplay">
start the evolution process!

<p id="evo_autoplay_stop">

</p>

<p id="evo_10_followup">
(Note: occasionally, <span class="grudge">Chain Validators</span> persist
alongside <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span>, because they score equally well.)
<br><br>
Game theory suggests something profound:
the honesty enforced by Bitcoin's consensus rules isn't just good policy – 
it's mathematically optimal. <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> win because
they cooperate when others cooperate, &amp; punish defectors immediately.
However...
</p>
<p id="evo_10_btn">
...there's still a problem: &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_11">
Look at the real world. Miners still attack. Consensus rules get forked.
<br><br>
If honesty &amp; fair validation are so mathematically superior –
if 15 years of Bitcoin evolution has shown <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> dominate –
why do attacks happen? Why do chains fragment? What causes network distrust?
<br><br>
The answer is in the question itself: we're talking about <i>game structure.</i>
What happens when the game <i>itself</i> changes?
What could cause <i>strategic dishonesty</i> to emerge?
<br><br>
What could lead to...
</p>
<p id="evo_11_btn">
...the evolution of <i>distrust?</i>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - DISTRUST - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="distrust_1">
Before everything breaks down, let's start with a healthy network!
Here's a majority of <span class="all_c">Full Nodes</span> validating honestly,
plus one <span class="all_d">51% Attacker</span> and one <span class="tft">Honest Node</span>.
<br><br>
Use the buttons to step through the evolution round-by-round,
or let it play out automatically. Watch what happens to trust. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_2">
As you know, <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> dominate under normal circumstances!
<br><br>
But that's under <i>current</i> rules. What if we change the game
by introducing <i>network delay</i> – blocks take time to propagate?
</p>

<p id="distrust_3">
Now, what if block propagation isn't instant?
</p>

<p id="distrust_3_small">
(what does latency mean for the game? let's see...)
</p>

<p id="distrust_4_top">
When block propagation is delayed, nodes don't all see the same chain at the same time.
This creates an opportunity:
</p>

<p id="distrust_4a">
<b>The race attack:</b> You mine a block secretly. While others validate it, 
you start mining the next block yourself.
When your block propagates, you might have a 2-block lead!
This hidden mining (selfish mining) can be profitable if you have enough hash power.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_a">
If a node knows others will see its blocks with delay,
it can <i>exploit</i> that delay by mining in secret.
Suddenly, <span class="all_d">Always Cheat</span> becomes profitable even against <span class="tft">Copycat</span>!
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_b">
This is called: <b>selfish mining</b>.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_c">
If people can't see what you're doing, game theory shifts.
Honest behavior is rewarded less. Selfish behavior is rewarded more.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4_btm">
Now the whole network spirals into distrust:
</p>

<p id="distrust_5">
Because some miners can profit from selfish mining when latency is high,
their share of the network grows.
As dishonest miners become common, even honest miners feel pressured to attack
to stay competitive.
</p>

<p id="distrust_6">
And once everyone is attacking each other?
Nobody can trust anybody.
The network fractures.
Different mining pools create different fork chains.
Security degrades.
</p>

<p id="distrust_7">
So our epidemic of distrust comes from <b>changing the game structure.</b>
When participants can't observe each other's actions clearly,
when delays create information asymmetry,
when incentives reward hidden behavior...
trust collapses, <i>even among rational actors.</i>
</p>

<p id="distrust_8">
This is Bitcoin's core challenge:
<b>How do we design the game so that honesty remains profitable
even when observation is imperfect?</b>
</p>

<p id="distrust_8_btm">
Solutions include:
</p>

<p id="distrust_8a">
<b>Faster blocks:</b> Reduce latency so selfish mining is harder.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8b">
<b>Stronger consensus rules:</b> Make attacks visible &amp; punishable.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8c">
<b>Decentralized validation:</b> More independent nodes catch attacks faster.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8d">
<b>Better incentives:</b> Reward behavior that strengthens the network,
not just individual profit.
</p>

<p id="distrust_9_top">
But these solutions create a tension:
stronger consensus rules can be fragile.
</p>

<p id="distrust_9">
Interestingly, Bitcoin's solution wasn't to centralize authority
(which would solve the game but destroy decentralization).
Instead, Bitcoin:
</p>

<p id="distrust_10a">
<b>Made the rules transparent:</b> Everyone agrees on the same consensus rules,
globally, forever.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10b">
<b>Made attacks visible:</b> Any deviation from consensus is immediately detectable
by anyone running a node.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10c">
<b>Made punishment automatic:</b> Invalid blocks are rejected. Cheaters gain nothing.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10d">
<b>Made the game infinite:</b> Miners face the same rules forever,
so short-term attack gains don't justify long-term reputation loss.
</p>

<p id="distrust_11_top">
By changing the game structure itself,
Bitcoin made honesty the dominant strategy.
Not because everyone is good,
but because the rules make cheating unprofitable.
</p>

<p id="distrust_11_end">
So now, the question becomes:
How do we further strengthen these rules?
How do we make attacks even more costly?
How do we scale decentralization while maintaining game-theoretic security?
</p>

<p id="distrust_btn">
And how do we use cryptographic proofs to verify this? &rarr;

<p id="noise_intro">
<b>But there's another challenge:</b>
What if nodes make <i>honest mistakes</i>?
</p>

<p id="noise_intro_small">
(what does noise (mistakes) do to the game?)
</p>

<p id="noise_1">
Here's the same network, but now there's a 1% chance each block is validated incorrectly
(due to software bugs, hardware faults, network glitches, etc).
</p>

<p id="noise_2_top">
Oh no!
</p>

<p id="noise_2">
<span class="all_c">Naive Full Nodes</span>, who always trust others' blocks,
get tricked by mistakes into accepting invalid data.
Their trust is punished by the network rejecting their chains.
</p>

<p id="noise_3">
But notice: <span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> still survive!
</p>

<p id="noise_4">
Why? Because they don't just validate once – they maintain state.
They catch mistakes when they see conflicting data,
and they respond by being more defensive next time.
</p>

<p id="noise_5">
This is why Bitcoin has:
</p>

<p id="noise_5a">
<b>Full nodes running complete validation:</b>
Bitcoin nodes don't just trust—they verify every transaction, every signature, every rule. Every block is independently validated.
This is why Bitcoin survived network delays, attacks, and bugs for 15 years.
</p>

<p id="noise_5b">
<b>Peer review of code changes:</b>
Any proposed change to Bitcoin's rules requires honest nodes to accept it. One node can't force an upgrade—the majority must agree.
This is why hard forks require consensus, and why contentious changes get rejected (like the 2MB block size increase).
</p>

<p id="noise_5c">
<b>Consensus rules as the game's foundation:</b>
Blocks that violate consensus rules are rejected by the entire network, regardless of who mines them.
This makes attacking unprofitable: your blocks get orphaned, your hash power is wasted, attackers eventually give up.
</p>

<p id="noise_6_top">
The lesson: <b>Even with noise, the game works.</b>
</p>

<p id="noise_6">
But only if:
1. Nodes validate independently
2. They respond to errors (don't just trust)
3. They maintain a shared record (consensus)
</p>

<p id="noise_6_end">
Robust systems aren't built on perfect actors.
They're built on game theory that survives imperfect information.
</p>

<p id="noise_btn">
But we can make this even better with cryptographic proof. Let's see how... &rarr;

<span class="tft">Honest Nodes</span> win when:
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_1">
...the reward for mutual honesty (R) is high enough
compared to temptation (T).
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_2">
...the network can punish cheaters fast enough
that they don't accumulate wealth.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_3">
...honest nodes outnumber dishonest ones initially,
OR the rules make dishonesty unprofitable from the start.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_4">
...the game is repeated infinitely,
so short-term gains don't outweigh long-term losses.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_5">
This is the core insight behind Bitcoin's design:
<br><br>
• <b>Block rewards (R):</b> Bitcoin gives miners 6.25 BTC per honest block. This makes cooperation profitable.
<br>
• <b>Difficulty adjustment (T):</b> Attacks are expensive—you need 51% of the network's hash power. Most attackers can't afford it.
<br>
• <b>Consensus rules (P):</b> Invalid blocks are rejected. Even if you control 51% hash power, you can't force the network to accept violations.
<br><br>
These aren't accident. They're designed to make honesty the dominant strategy.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_conclusion">
So here's the critical insight: <b>Trust isn't about believing people are good. It's about designing systems where honesty is the only profitable strategy.</b>
<br><br>
Bitcoin achieves this through game theory, not through a central authority.
When you change the payoffs (increase block rewards, lower mining difficulty, alter consensus rules), you change which strategies win.
Honest nodes dominate when honesty is rewarded. Attackers emerge when attacks are underpriced.
<br><br>
This is why governance matters. The community must actively maintain the game structure that makes Bitcoin work.

<!-- - - - - CONCLUSION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="conclusion_top">
<b>So here's what we learned:</b>
</p>

<p id="conclusion_1">
Single transactions create a prisoner's dilemma: rational actors cheat.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_2">
Repeated games change everything: honest strategies win because players face each other forever.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_3">
Tournament evolution shows: even when cheaters start strong, honesty dominates long-term.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_4">
Changing the game (adding delays, noise, attacks) can make trust collapse...
</p>

<p id="conclusion_5">
...but stronger consensus rules, transparency, &amp; verification can restore it.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_6">
Bitcoin applies these principles:<br>
• <b>Global consensus rules:</b> Every node validates the same way (the game is always the same)<br>
• <b>Transparent validation:</b> All transactions are public (everyone sees if you cheat)<br>
• <b>Automatic punishment:</b> Invalid blocks are rejected by the entire network (attackers can't win)<br>
• <b>Infinite repetition:</b> Bitcoin runs forever (so attacking today destroys tomorrow's profits)<br>
• <b>Decentralized participation:</b> Thousands of independent nodes (no single authority to bribe)
</p>

<p id="conclusion_7">
The result: a system where millions of strangers maintain a shared ledger <i>without trusting a central authority.</i>
<br><br>
It works not because everyone is honest – but because <b>honesty is the only profitable strategy.</b>
An attacker might gain short-term advantage, but the network punishes them, reputation spreads, and honest nodes dominate long-term.
This is why Bitcoin survived 15+ years without being hacked or requiring central control.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_end">
That's the evolution of trust.
<br><br>
And now, using Charms protocol, we can make these game moves verifiable on-chain—turning reputation into programmable governance power on Bitcoin itself.

Now comes the powerful part: your game history proves your trustworthiness.
</p>

<p id="governance_intro_text">
You cooperated [COOPERATION_RATE]% across [TOTAL_MOVES] moves. That consistency earned you <span class="[TIER_CLASS]">[TIER_LABEL]</span> status.<br><br>

In Bitcoin, nodes that validate honestly don't just earn block rewards – they earn the right to shape the network's future. 
Miners with strong track records propose protocol changes. Nodes with consistent uptime vote on consensus rules.
Your reputation is their voting power.<br><br>

With <b>[VOTING_POWER] votes</b>, you now have real influence. This is how Bitcoin actually evolves:

</p>

<p id="governance_explain">
Your votes just changed Bitcoin's game rules. That might sound hypothetical, but it's how real Bitcoin governance works.
</p>

<p id="governance_example">
Bitcoin's history is full of proposals: Segregated Witness (faster transactions), Taproot (more privacy), Fee markets (different block sizes).
Each time, the network had to answer: should we change the rules?
<br><br>
Miners voted with their hash power. Nodes voted by choosing which software to run.
Exchanges voted by which transactions they'd accept. The winners? Proposals backed by participants who maintained network security.
<br><br>
The proposal that passed this round will be encoded into the blockchain itself.
Future players will inherit these rules—shaped by participants like you who cooperated and earned voting power.
</p>

<p id="governance_vision">
This is how Bitcoin actually works: decentralized governance where influence flows to participants with proven track records.
Not "one coin, one vote" – but "one reputation, one vote."
The math ensures that attackers can't control voting power, because attacking destroys the reputation required to propose changes.
