<p id="intro">
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto solved an ancient problem:
<br><br>
<b>How do strangers exchange value without a bank?</b>
<br><br>
Bitcoin works because the game rules reward consensus-following and make divergence less profitable.
Miners don't need to trust each other — they align their strategies because the payoff structure aligns their incentives.
<br><br>
<b>Game theory is the answer.</b>
<br><br>
Let's play the Bitcoin game and see how it works...
</p>
<p id="intro_button">

<p id="why_this_works_top">
<b>Why Bitcoin's approach worked when others failed</b>
</p>

<p id="why_this_works_1">
Governments and banks solved double-spending with <i>a ledger-keeper:</i> a central authority<br>
who decides which transactions are valid. Trust the bank, you trust the system.
<br><br>
But cryptographers wanted to do it without a central authority. They tried signatures, hashing, encryption.<br>
None of it worked. Without a central timestamp, you can't prove which coin was spent first.
</p>

<p id="why_this_works_2">
Bitcoin's breakthrough:
<br><b>Distributed ledger + game theory.</b>
<br><br>
Thousands of nodes instead of one authority.
Proof-of-work + incentives make diverging from consensus less profitable than aligning with it.
</p>

<p id="why_this_works_btn">
So let's play the game Bitcoin nodes play every day. &rarr;

<p id="oneoff_0_top">
<b>A SINGLE BLOCK</b> — You're a miner choosing which chain to build on.
<br>
<b>CONSENSUS:</b> Build on the chain everyone else is using, earn +2. Safe. &nbsp; <b>FORK:</b> Build your own chain, earn +3 if miners follow you, but earn 0 if they stick with consensus.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
<b>The other miner just built on a different fork.</b><br>
Do you join the consensus or build your own chain?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_game_to_bitcoin">
<b>FROM GAME THEORY TO BITCOIN</b><br>
<br>
This isn't just an abstract game. These exact dynamics play out every day in Bitcoin mining:
<br>
• <b>Consensus-Following</b> = Build on the longest valid chain (majority rule)
• <b>Divergent Path</b> = Build on a minority fork (alternative consensus choice)
• <b>Payoffs</b> = BTC rewards scale with network alignment; divergent paths earn less as the consensus chain grows
• <b>Strategies</b> = Different mining approaches (responsive to feedback, always-consensus, adaptive, etc.)
<br>
Bitcoin's design principle: the network follows the longest valid chain, so consensus-aligned strategies earn more over time.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_bitcoin_economics">
<b>BITCOIN BLOCK ECONOMICS</b><br>
<br>
These payoffs reflect real Bitcoin mining economics based on fork consensus:
<br>
• <span data-bitcoin-tooltip="When both miners build on the consensus chain, the entire network validates both blocks. Both miners earn the full block reward (currently 6.25 BTC) plus transaction fees.">Both Follow Consensus (R=2)</span>: Both miners earn 6.25 BTC + fees (full reward)
<br>
• <span data-bitcoin-tooltip="When you follow the consensus chain but another miner builds on a minority fork, the network rejects their fork. Your blocks get full network validation, theirs get reduced acceptance.">You Follow Consensus (S=-1)</span>: You earn full reward, other miner's fork rejected
<br>
• <span data-bitcoin-tooltip="When you build a minority fork while others follow consensus, some nodes might follow you initially, but the network coordinates around the majority chain. Your blocks earn reduced rewards as the majority chain becomes more secure.">You Build Minority Fork (T=3)</span>: Short-term reward from minority followers, but long-term loss as consensus chain grows
<br>
• <span data-bitcoin-tooltip="When both miners build different forks, the network splits. Both chains become weaker, less validated, and less secure. Neither fork attracts strong support.">Both Build Different Forks (P=0)</span>: Network splits, both chains earn reduced rewards
<br>
<br>
The key: Bitcoin's consensus mechanism (longest chain wins) makes following the majority consensus the most profitable strategy over time.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_bitcoin_difficulty">
<b>LONG-TERM INCENTIVES & DIFFICULTY</b><br>
<br>
Bitcoin's design isn't based on altruism. It makes diverging from consensus more expensive than aligning with it:
<br>
• <b>Difficulty Adjustment</b>: Every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks), Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty to maintain constant block time. This ensures divergent chains fall behind faster.
<br>
• <b>Cost to Diverge</b>: Diverging costs the same hash power as consensus-following, but earns less because minority followers are fewer. Consensus chains accumulate faster.
<br>
• <b>Network Coordination</b>: The longest valid chain becomes the canonical chain. Blocks on divergent paths get orphaned, reducing rewards.
<br>
• <b>Compound Advantage</b>: After 780,000 blocks, consensus-aligned miners have earned full rewards. Divergent miners have earned from fewer followers and face increasing rejection.
<br>
<br>
The math is undeniable: <b>consensus-aligned strategies accumulate more wealth</b> in the long run.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_fork_choice">
<b>FORK CHOICE RULE: LONGEST VALID CHAIN WINS</b><br>
<br>
This game implements Bitcoin's actual fork choice rule:
<br>
• <b>Both Consensus-Following</b>: Both miners' blocks get accepted and validated. Network grows steadily.
<br>
• <b>One Diverges</b>: Divergent miner's minority fork accumulates slower. Consensus chain grows faster, making the divergent blocks orphaned. Consensus-following miner earns more.
<br>
• <b>Both Diverge Differently</b>: Network splits. Both chains grow slowly, accumulating fewer followers. Both earn less due to reduced network coordination.
<br>
<br>
This creates the <b>emergent dominant strategy</b>: consensus-aligned strategies earn more because the network coordinates around the longest valid chain.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_reputation">
<b>NETWORK EFFECTS & REPUTATION</b><br>
<br>
In Bitcoin, reputation isn't just a game score – it has real consequences:
<br>
• <b>Trusted Nodes</b>: Nodes with good reputation get prioritized block relay, reducing orphan rates.
<br>
• <b>Suspicious Nodes</b>: Nodes that attack get banned from mempool access, reducing their profitability.
<br>
• <b>Permanent Blacklists</b>: Once banned, nodes must change IP addresses to rejoin the network.
<br>
• <b>Economic Incentives</b>: Honest miners earn compounding rewards. Attackers face increasing costs.
<br>
<br>
This is why <span class="tft">Responsive Validator</span> dominates in the long run – it's not just about one block, but about building a sustainable mining business.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_bitcoin_history">
<b>REAL BITCOIN HISTORY LESSONS</b><br>
<br>
These game mechanics reflect actual Bitcoin events:
<br>
• <b>2010 Integer Overflow</b>: A bug allowed creation of 184 billion BTC. Honest nodes rejected the invalid blocks.
<br>
• <b>2013 Mt. Gox Failure</b>: Centralized exchange collapse showed risks of not following consensus.
<br>
• <b>2017 Bitcoin Cash Fork</b>: Consensus rule divergence created two separate networks.
<br>
• <b>2021 China Mining Migration</b>: Difficulty adjustment proved resilient when 50%+ hashrate went offline.
<br>
<br>
Each crisis proved that <b>honest validation</b> is the only sustainable strategy.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_attacked">
Right! Building your own fork gives you a temporary advantage, but the network follows the consensus chain.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Following consensus is safer, but you're vulnerable if others build forks and gain network support.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
<b>First, here's the incentive:</b> If you follow consensus but they build a fork, their minority chain gets less network support. You earn full reward (+2), they earn reduced reward (0.5).
<br><br>
<b>This is why forking seems rational.</b> Your choice:
<br>• Follow Consensus = secure and profitable, but subject to majority
<br>• Build Fork = potential short-term gain, but reduced long-term acceptance
<br><br>
But this is just one block. Bitcoin isn't one block. It's eternal repetition, where miners face each other forever.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
<b>But let's say the other miner follows the consensus chain.</b><br>
What should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_attacked">
Harsh... but yes, if you can get away with breaking the rules, you might gain short-term advantage.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Noble! Sure, seems right... <b>OR IS IT??</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
<b>Now here's the reality of mutual cooperation:</b>
<br><br>
If you both build consensus: you both earn steady, reliable rewards (+2 each). The network is secure. No one steals anything.
<br><br>
But look at the incentive: if you fork while they stay on consensus, you get +3 while they get -1. You win bigger in the short term.
<br><br>
<b>Game theory's paradox:</b> Individually, forking pays more (+3 vs +2). But only if you're the one forking while they're honest. So game theory says: FORK is the "rational" choice... even though mutual consensus (+2 each) beats mutual forking (0 each).
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
And <i>that's</i> Bitcoin's core challenge.
Individual miners have incentive to fork off, even if it destroys the network's value for everyone.
Sometimes, breaking consensus <i>seems</i> rational in isolation!
But what happens if we play this game...

Your game is complete. Let's calculate your reputation.
</p>

<p id="reputation_reveal">
You cooperated [COOPERATION_COUNT] times. You defected [DEFECTION_COUNT] times.
That's a [COOPERATION_RATE]% cooperation rate, earning you <span class="[TIER_CLASS]">[TIER_LABEL]</span> status.
<br><br>
In Bitcoin, this score means something tangible:
<br>
If you were a node validating transactions, [TIER_LABEL] nodes are [TIER_DESCRIPTION].
Your voting power on protocol changes would be [VOTING_POWER] votes.
</p>

<p id="reputation_what_it_means">
<b>What does [TIER_LABEL] mean in Bitcoin?</b>
<br><br>
<b>Trusted nodes (75%+):</b> These are the miners and validators the community trusts with network upgrades. Their proposals get heard. Their votes carry weight. When they propose rule changes, other nodes listen.
<br><br>
<b>Neutral nodes (50-74%):</b> These are solid, mostly-honest participants. They contribute to consensus but haven't proven exceptional reliability. Their votes count, but they don't have outsized influence.
<br><br>
<b>Learning nodes (0-49%):</b> These participants defected frequently. Bitcoin's design punishes this—attackers face network rejection. Your participation helps, but you haven't yet proven you're trustworthy with governance power.

<p id="who_were">
So who were these different network participants you interacted with?
</p>

<p id="character_tft">
<b>RESPONSIVE VALIDATOR:</b>
Each interaction, I mirror your previous strategy. If you built on the consensus chain, I do the same. If you diverged, I diverge proportionally in return.
This is reciprocal strategy matching: my payoff correlates with yours.
</p>

<p id="character_all_d">
<b>DIVERGENT MINER:</b>
I have enough hash power to ignore the longest-chain rule and build my own fork. I pursue divergent paths regardless of what others do.
Short-term: minority followers reward me. Long-term: as the consensus chain grows, my fork becomes orphaned.
</p>

<p id="character_all_c">
<b>CONSENSUS FOLLOWER:</b>
I validate everything according to Bitcoin's consensus rules, regardless of incentives or what others do.
Pure rule-following. This means I never diverge—but I also never strategically adapt to different payoff structures.
</p>

<p id="character_grudge">
<b>PENALIZING VALIDATOR:</b>
I validate according to consensus rules. When a peer sends me invalid blocks, I permanently reduce their reputation score.
In Bitcoin: their blocks get de-prioritized, relayed slower, until eventually that peer is disconnected from my node.
This reputation system drives invalid-block producers out of the network.
</p>

<p id="character_prober">
<b>ADAPTIVE VALIDATOR:</b>
First interaction: I validate according to consensus rules to learn your strategy. Second interaction: I test whether you follow consensus even under pressure.
If you remain consensus-aligned, I stay consensus-aligned forever.
If you diverge, I diverge permanently.

Minority strategies face a payoff ceiling: they can't earn much without the consensus following them. The game structure punishes divergence.

<p id="tournament_7">
This is Bitcoin's design at work: the longest-chain rule makes consensus-following more profitable than divergence.
</p>
<p id="tournament_8">
The pattern is clear: when the game rewards majority alignment, majority-aligned strategies accumulate more.

(Sorry about your prediction: [CHAR].)

<p id="tournament_winner_3">
In a repeated game, the payoff-maximizing strategy aligns with consensus: cooperate when others cooperate, respond to defection.
<br><br>
But that's game theory. On Bitcoin, the protocol makes consensus the only option—divergent blocks get rejected and earn zero rewards.
<br><br>
So let's strip away Bitcoin's enforcement and ask: if all strategies competed equally, with no protocol rejection, what would dominate over time?
</p>
<p id="tournament_teaser">
Let's watch evolution in action. &rarr;

<!-- - - - - EVOLUTION! - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="evolution_intro">
Now, let's imagine Bitcoin's node population <i>evolving over time</i>. The process is simple:
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_1">
<b>1. RUN A FULL TOURNAMENT</b><br>
All node types validate &amp; interact; tally their rewards.
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_2">
<b>2. RETIRE WORST NODES</b><br>
Remove the 5 lowest-scoring node types. (ties broken randomly)

<b>3. ADD COPIES OF BEST NODES</b><br>
Clone the 5 highest-scoring node types. (ties broken randomly)
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_footer">
...and REPEAT. Think of this as natural selection:
bad behaviors are replaced, good behaviors spread.
All that's needed is that unsuccessful behaviors (low scores) go away,
and successful behaviors (high scores) are imitated by new nodes.
So now...
</p>
<p id="evolution_intro_button">
...let's watch this unfold. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_1">
Imagine a network where all strategies compete equally—no protocol enforcement, no rejected blocks. Just pure game theory.
<br><br>
Say it starts with:
<span class="all_c">15 Consensus Followers</span> (always validate honestly),
<span class="all_d">5 Divergent Miners</span> (always attack), and
<span class="tft">5 Responsive Validators</span> (validate fairly, respond to attacks).
(We'll ignore <span class="grudge">Penalizing Validators</span> &amp; <span class="prober">Adaptive Validators</span> for now)
<br><br>
We'll run a tournament, eliminate the lowest-scoring strategies, and replicate the winners. Repeat a dozen times.
<br><br>
Who dominates in this simulation?
<b>PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>
</p>

<p id="evo_2_all_c">
Makes sense, Consensus Followers outnumber everyone – honesty should dominate right now...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_all_d">
Makes sense, Divergent Miners can exploit the trusting Consensus Followers...
</p>
<p id="evo_2_tft">
Makes sense, Responsive Validators won the tournament already, why not again?...
</p>
<p id="evo_2">
Let's see if you're right:
</p>

<p id="label_play_tournament">
1) run tournament
</p>
<p id="label_eliminate_bottom_5">
2) retire bottom 5
</p>
<p id="label_reproduce_top_5">
3) replicate top 5
</p>

<p id="evo_3_all_c">
Sadly, <span class="all_c">Consensus Followers</span> got exploited by
<span class="all_d">Divergent Miners</span>, whose population increased.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_all_d">
You're right! <span class="all_d">Divergent Miners</span> won this round,
exploiting the naive <span class="all_c">Consensus Followers</span>.
</p>
<p id="evo_3_tft">
Sadly, <span class="tft">Responsive Validators</span> didn't win – but they survived better than <span class="all_c">Consensus Followers</span>,
who got exploited by <span class="all_d">Divergent Miners</span>.
</p>
<p id="evo_3">
Let's see what happens over several more rounds...
</p>

<p id="evo_4">
Round after round, the network composition shifts. High-scoring strategies replicate. Low-scoring ones fade.
</p>

<p id="evo_5">
Population changes compound. Early advantages can trigger cascades.
</p>

<p id="evo_6">
In game theory, what happens when one strategy eliminating another leaves it vulnerable to a third?
</p>

<p id="evo_7">
Strategies that exploit naivety thrive initially. Strategies that respond proportionally survive longer.
</p>

<p id="evo_8">
After a dozen rounds, a pattern emerges...
</p>

<p id="evo_9">
In this simulation—where all strategies compete equally—what you just watched is what emerges from game theory alone, with no protocol enforcement.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_c">
You predicted <span class="all_c">Consensus Followers</span> would dominate, but they got exploited.
The lesson: sheer honesty without reciprocal response isn't stable against coordinated defection.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_all_d">
You predicted <span class="all_d">Divergent Miners</span> would dominate. In this simulation, they did—at least initially.
But this is pure game theory without Bitcoin's protocol enforcement.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_tft">
You predicted <span class="tft">Responsive Validators</span> would dominate, and in this simulation, they did.
Fair validation combined with proportional response beats both pure honesty and pure defection.
</p>
<p id="evo_9_end">
But on Bitcoin, the outcome is predetermined by protocol.
<br><br>
In 2010, someone attempted to exploit the system (the Bitcoin overflow exploit). The protocol rejected it.
In 2013-2015, various pools tried 51% attacks. The protocol rejected them.
In 2017, the "Bitcoin Cash" fork attempt: the protocol enforced the original rules.
<br><br>
Bitcoin didn't rely on consensus dominance through competition. It locked in consensus through cryptography.

What you just witnessed is game theory in action. No protocol enforcement. No central authority. Just payoff-driven selection.
<br><br>
The winner depends on the starting conditions, the order of interactions, and random chance. But certain patterns emerge: 
strategies that exploit naivety thrive initially. Strategies that cooperate and respond proportionally last longer. Pure defection eventually collapses—unless victims can't leave.
<br><br>
However...
</p>
<p id="evo_10_btn">
...there's still a problem: &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_bitcoin_mechanism">
In our simulation, all strategies competed fairly. On Bitcoin, the consensus rules eliminate divergence from the start: rejected blocks earn zero rewards.
<br><br>
The protocol doesn't just incentivize consensus—it makes divergence economically impossible.
<br><br>
So if Bitcoin's design solves the prisoner's dilemma so completely... why do attacks happen in the real world?
</p>
<p id="evo_bitcoin_mechanism_btn">
Let's explore when incentives shift: &rarr;
</p>

<p id="evo_11">
But look at the real world. Miners still attack. Consensus rules get forked. Networks fragment.
<br><br>
In our simulation, game theory predicted certain winners. On Bitcoin, that doesn't happen—the protocol decides.
<br><br>
Yet attacks still occur. Why? The answer is: <i>the game structure itself changes.</i>
What happens when new incentives emerge? What could cause a strategy that was losing to suddenly become profitable?
<br><br>
What could lead to...
</p>
<p id="evo_11_btn">
...the evolution of <i>distrust?</i>
</p>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - DISTRUST - - - - - - -->
<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="distrust_1">
Before everything breaks down, let's start with a healthy network!
Here's a majority of <span class="all_c">Consensus Followers</span> validating honestly,
plus one <span class="all_d">Divergent Miner</span> and one <span class="tft">Responsive Validator</span>.
<br><br>
Use the buttons to step through the evolution round-by-round,
or let it play out automatically. Watch what happens to trust. &rarr;
</p>

<p id="distrust_2">
In that simulation, a clear winner emerged based on game theory alone.
<br><br>
But that outcome assumed a fixed set of rules. What if the game structure itself changes?
<br><br>
What if we introduce <i>network delay</i> – blocks take time to propagate?
</p>

<p id="distrust_3">
Now, what if block propagation isn't instant?
</p>

<p id="distrust_3_small">
(what does latency mean for the game? let's see...)
</p>

<p id="distrust_4_top">
When block propagation is delayed, nodes don't all see the same chain at the same time.
This creates an opportunity:
</p>

<p id="distrust_4a">
<b>The race attack:</b> You mine a block secretly. While others validate it, 
you start mining the next block yourself.
When your block propagates, you might have a 2-block lead!
This hidden mining (selfish mining) can be profitable if you have enough hash power.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_a">
If a node knows others will see its blocks with delay,
it can <i>exploit</i> that delay by mining in secret.
Suddenly, <span class="all_d">Divergent Miner</span> becomes profitable even against <span class="tft">Responsive Validator</span>!
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_b">
This is called: <b>selfish mining</b>.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4b_c">
If people can't see what you're doing, game theory shifts.
Honest behavior is rewarded less. Selfish behavior is rewarded more.
</p>

<p id="distrust_4_btm">
Now the whole network spirals into distrust:
</p>

<p id="distrust_5">
Because some miners can profit from selfish mining when latency is high,
their share of the network grows.
As dishonest miners become common, even honest miners feel pressured to attack
to stay competitive.
</p>

<p id="distrust_6">
And once everyone is attacking each other?
Nobody can trust anybody.
The network fractures.
Different mining pools create different fork chains.
Security degrades.
</p>

<p id="distrust_7">
The core problem: when delays hide actions, attacks become profitable and trust collapses.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8">
<b>Bitcoin's solution:</b> Make the rules transparent and immutable.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8_btm">
Every node enforces the exact same rules. Forever. Globally.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8a">
No central authority can change the game mid-play.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8b">
No miner can profit from rule-breaking because all nodes reject it.
</p>

<p id="distrust_8c">
Honesty becomes the only profitable strategy.
</p>

<p id="distrust_9_top">
And that's how Bitcoin stays secure for 15+ years.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10b">
<b>Made attacks visible:</b> Any deviation from consensus is immediately detectable
by anyone running a node.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10c">
<b>Made punishment automatic:</b> Invalid blocks are rejected. Cheaters gain nothing.
</p>

<p id="distrust_10d">
<b>Made the game infinite:</b> Miners face the same rules forever,
so short-term attack gains don't justify long-term reputation loss.
</p>

<p id="distrust_11_top">
By changing the game structure itself,
Bitcoin made honesty the dominant strategy.
Not because everyone is good,
but because the rules make cheating unprofitable.
</p>

<p id="distrust_11_end">
So now, the question becomes:
How do we further strengthen these rules?
How do we make attacks even more costly?
How do we scale decentralization while maintaining game-theoretic security?
</p>

<p id="distrust_btn">
And how do we use cryptographic proofs to verify this? &rarr;

<p id="noise_intro">
<b>But there's another challenge:</b>
What if nodes make <i>honest mistakes</i>?
</p>

<p id="noise_intro_small">
(what does noise (mistakes) do to the game?)
</p>

<p id="noise_1">
Here's the same network, but now there's a 1% chance each block is validated incorrectly
(due to software bugs, hardware faults, network glitches, etc).
</p>

<p id="noise_2_top">
Oh no!
</p>

<p id="noise_2">
<span class="all_c">Naive Consensus Followers</span>, who always trust others' blocks,
get tricked by mistakes into accepting invalid data.
Their trust is punished by the network rejecting their chains.
</p>

<p id="noise_3">
But notice: <span class="tft">Responsive Validators</span> still survive!
</p>

<p id="noise_4">
Why? Because they don't just validate once – they maintain state.
They catch mistakes when they see conflicting data,
and they respond by being more defensive next time.
</p>

<p id="noise_5">
This is why Bitcoin has:
</p>

<p id="noise_5a">
<b>Full nodes validate independently:</b>
Don't trust, verify. Every transaction, every signature, every rule. Mistakes are caught.
</p>

<p id="noise_5b">
<b>Consensus rules are fixed:</b>
All nodes enforce the same rules. Blocks that break rules get rejected, making attacks unprofitable.
</p>

<p id="noise_5c">
<b>Honest nodes thrive together:</b>
When everyone validates fairly, attackers can't profit. The game stabilizes.
</p>

<p id="noise_6_top">
The lesson: <b>Even with noise, the game works.</b>
</p>

<p id="noise_6">
But only if:
1. Nodes validate independently
2. They respond to errors (don't just trust)
3. They maintain a shared record (consensus)
</p>

<p id="noise_6_end">
Robust systems aren't built on perfect actors.
They're built on game theory that survives imperfect information.

<p id="sandbox_after_4">

</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_5">
This is the core insight behind Bitcoin's design:
<br><br>
• <b>Block rewards (R):</b> Bitcoin gives miners 6.25 BTC per honest block. This makes cooperation profitable.
<br>
• <b>Difficulty adjustment (T):</b> Attacks are expensive—you need 51% of the network's hash power. Most attackers can't afford it.
<br>
• <b>Consensus rules (P):</b> Invalid blocks are rejected. Even if you control 51% hash power, you can't force the network to accept violations.
<br><br>
These aren't accident. They're designed to make honesty the dominant strategy.
</p>

<p id="sandbox_after_conclusion">
So here's the critical insight: <b>Trust isn't about believing people are good. It's about designing systems where honesty is the only profitable strategy.</b>
<br><br>
Bitcoin achieves this through game theory, not through a central authority.
When you change the payoffs (increase block rewards, lower mining difficulty, alter consensus rules), you change which behaviors win.
Honest nodes dominate when honesty is rewarded. Attackers emerge when attacks are underpriced.
<br><br>
This is why governance matters. The community must actively maintain the game structure that makes Bitcoin work.

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="conclusion_top">
<b>So here's what we learned:</b>
</p>

<p id="conclusion_1">
Single transactions create a prisoner's dilemma: rational actors cheat.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_2">
Repeated games change everything: honest strategies win because players face each other forever.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_3">
Tournament evolution shows: even when cheaters start strong, honesty dominates long-term.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_4">
Changing the game (adding delays, noise, attacks) can make trust collapse...
</p>

<p id="conclusion_5">
...but stronger consensus rules, transparency, &amp; verification can restore it.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_6">
Bitcoin applies these principles:<br>
• <b>Global consensus rules:</b> Every node validates the same way (Nakamoto consensus: longest valid chain wins)<br>
• <b>Transparent validation:</b> All transactions are public (everyone sees if you cheat)<br>
• <b>Automatic punishment:</b> Invalid blocks are rejected by the entire network (attackers can't win)<br>
• <b>Infinite repetition:</b> Bitcoin runs forever (so attacking today destroys tomorrow's profits)<br>
• <b>Decentralized participation:</b> Thousands of independent nodes (no single authority to bribe)<br>
• <b>Economic alignment:</b> Honest miners earn 6.25 BTC + fees per block. Attackers spend $15B/year just to try.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_7">
The result: a system where millions of strangers maintain a shared ledger <i>without trusting a central authority.</i>
<br><br>
It works not because everyone is altruistic – but because <b>Bitcoin makes stealing more expensive than earning.</b>
<br><br>
After 780,000 blocks:
• Honest nodes have earned ~10 million BTC in cumulative rewards
• Attack strategies have earned 0 BTC
• The math is undeniable: <b>honesty dominates</b>
<br><br>
This is why Bitcoin survived 15+ years without being hacked or requiring central control. The incentives are aligned: what's good for you is good for the network.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_bitcoin_final">
<b>BITCOIN'S GENIUS: INCENTIVE ALIGNMENT</b><br>
<br>
• Short-term temptation (T=3) seems rational in isolation
• But long-term honesty (R=2) compounds infinitely
• Attacking costs $15B/year while honest mining earns $15B/year
• The network always chooses the longest <b>valid</b> chain
• Reputation persists: attackers get permanently blacklisted
<br><br>
Bitcoin doesn't require trust. It <b>engineers trust</b> through game theory and economics.
</p>

<p id="conclusion_end">
That's the evolution of trust.
<br><br>
And now, using Charms protocol, we can make these game moves verifiable on-chain—turning reputation into programmable governance power on Bitcoin itself.

<p id="governance_intro">
Now comes the powerful part: your game history proves your trustworthiness.

<p id="governance_intro_text">
You cooperated [COOPERATION_RATE]% across [TOTAL_MOVES] moves. That consistency earned you <span class="[TIER_CLASS]">[TIER_LABEL]</span> status.<br><br>

In Bitcoin, nodes that validate honestly don't just earn block rewards – they earn the right to shape the network's future. 
Miners with strong track records propose protocol changes. Nodes with consistent uptime vote on consensus rules.

<p id="governance_explain">
Your votes just changed Bitcoin's game rules. That might sound hypothetical, but it's how real Bitcoin governance works.
</p>

<p id="governance_example">
Bitcoin's history is full of proposals: Segregated Witness (faster transactions), Taproot (more privacy), Fee markets (different block sizes).
Each time, the network had to answer: should we change the rules?
<br><br>
Miners voted with their hash power. Nodes voted by choosing which software to run.
Exchanges voted by which transactions they'd accept. The winners? Proposals backed by participants who maintained network security.
<br><br>
The proposal that passed this round will be encoded into the blockchain itself.
Future players will inherit these rules—shaped by participants like you who cooperated and earned voting power.
</p>

<p id="governance_vision">
This is how Bitcoin actually works: decentralized governance where influence flows to participants with proven track records.
Not "one coin, one vote" – but "one reputation, one vote."
The math ensures that attackers can't control voting power, because attacking destroys the reputation required to propose changes.
</p>

<p id="reputation_what_it_means">
Your reputation on Bitcoin means something real. It's not just a score – it's a measure of how consistently you've validated transactions honestly.
<br><br>
That consistency gives you voting power. Nodes with proven track records can propose protocol changes, and other nodes weight their votes by reputation.
This ensures that attackers – who damage their reputation through cheating – can't control the future of Bitcoin.

1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS

3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a2">
If the level of miscommunication is <i>too</i> high, trust breaks down.

the forgiving <span class="tf2t">Forgiving Node</span>,
the rigid <span class="pavlov">Reactive Node</span>, and

This is why "miscommunication" is such an interesting barrier to trust:

If there's one big takeaway<br>
from <i>all</i> of game theory, it's this:
<br><br>
<b>What the game is, defines what the players do.</b><br>
Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,<br>
it's that our <i>environment</i> acts against the evolution of trust.
<br><br>
That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment --
but as game theory reminds us, we <i>are</i> each others' environment.
<b>In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run,
it's us players who define the game.</b>
<br><br>
So, do what <i>you</i> can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.
